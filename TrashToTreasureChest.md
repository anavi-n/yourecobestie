# Your Eco Bestie's Trash to Treasure chest
I'm a low-waste / sustainable / eco-friendly / minimalist and I wanted to share resources to help those who might be interested in turning their 'trash' into another person's treasure

Here is a guide on you can do with items instead of throwing them in trash.

| Item | What you can do |
| ------ | -------------|
| Batteries | Drop off at local recycling places such as Home Depot, etc. |
| Clothes you no longer need | Donate to local women shelters or your local Buy Nothing group. You can also use as rags for cleaning. If all else fails, try [For Days take back bag](https://fordays.com/products/take-back-bag)|
| Crayons | Donate to [The Crayon Initiative](https://thecrayoninitiative.org/)
| New and gently used appliances, sinks, lumber, furniture, building materials, household goods and more from individuals and companies| Donate to [Habitat for Humanity ReStores](https://www.habitat.org/restores/donate-goods) Each ReStore is unique, and many locations also accept items outside these categories |
| Markers and highligthers | For markers and highlighters that are at the end of their life cycle, [Crayolaâ€™s ColorCycle](https://www.crayola.com/colorcycle) program for schools will accept all brands of plastic markers to be recycled and converted into clean-burning fuel
| Hair | Donate your hair to a program like [Locks of Love](https://locksoflove.org/) or Wigs for Kids. Natural, untreated hair is compostable so you can also ask your salon to bag it for you and compost it | 
| Laptops | Donate to [Computers for Causes](https://www.computerswithcauses.org/laptop-donation/) |
| Lipbalm containers | [Portland Bee Balm](https://portlandbeebalm.com/pages/recycle) only accepts their own lip balm containers | 
| Miscellanous items | Post on your local Buy Nothing Facebook group |
| Mascara wands | Clean and donate to [Wands for Wildlife](https://www.wandsforwildlife.org/donate-wands.html) |
| Towels | Donate to local animal shelters |
| Shoes | Donate to [Soles4Souls](https://soles4souls.org/give-shoes/) |
| Socks | Donate to [SmartWool's SecondCut]( ) program to upcycle them info new socks | 
| Stockings | You can try to upcycle them into hair ties | 
| Underwear | Donate to [Knickey's recycling program](https://knickey.com/pages/recycle) - they also take socks, bras, and tights; [Parade's take back program](https://yourparade.com/pages/take-back) also recycles them |
| Wedding flowers or other flowers | Get them pressed into a frame from a business like [Pressed Floral](https://pressedfloral.com/pages/recreation-options) - this is just an example, there's plenty of ways to preserve them or you could also compost them of course |
