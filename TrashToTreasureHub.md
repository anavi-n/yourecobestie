# Your Eco Bestie's Trash to Treasure hub
I'm a low-waste / sustainable / eco-friendly / minimalist and I wanted to share resources to help those who might be interested in turning their 'trash' into another person's treasure

Here is a guide on you can do with items instead of throwing them in trash.

| Item | What you can do |
| ------ | -------------|
| Clothes you no longer need | Donate to local women shelters. Use as rags for cleaning |
| Mascara wands | Clean and donate to [Wands for Wildlife](https://www.wandsforwildlife.org/donate-wands.html) |
| Towels | Donate to local animal shelters |
| Miscellanous items | Post on your local Buy Nothing Facebook group |
| Laptops |
| New and gently used appliances, sinks, lumber, furniture, building materials, household goods and more from individuals and companies| Donate to [Habitat for Humanity ReStores](https://www.habitat.org/restores/donate-goods) Each ReStore is unique, and many locations also accept items outside these categories |
| Batteries | Drop off at local recycling places such as Home Depot, etc. |
