# Your Eco Bestie's Trash to Treasure hub
I'm a low-waste / sustainable / eco-friendly / minimalist and I wanted to share resources to help those who might be interested in turning their 'trash' into another person's treasure

Here is a guide on you can do with items instead of throwing them in trash.

| Item | What you can do |
| ------ | -------------|
| Clothes you no longer need | Donate to local women shelters. Use as rags for cleaning |
| Mascara wands | Clean and donate to [Wands for Wildlife](https://www.wandsforwildlife.org/donate-wands.html) |
