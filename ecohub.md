# Your Eco Bestie's Eco Hub
I'm a  low-waste / sustainable / eco-friendly / minimalist and I wanted to share resources to help those who might be interested in similar topics. This is a guide to everything that is good for the earth and good for you! Follow me on instagram for more sustainable data-based tips [@yourecobestie](https://instagram.com/yourecobestie)

As always, the most sustainable thing you can do is use things you already have, finding a home for things you already have, or using them until end of their life. Buying secondhand is always superier to buying new from a sustainability standpoint. I'd also like to emphasize the sustainability angle on buying, for items we're bringing into our homes. I've noticed that this takes work and sometimes makes it the 'not-so-convenient' option so I wanted to share a repository of all things sustainable.
