# SustainablEverything

I'm a (barely) 20-something low-waste / sustaianable / eco-friendly / minimalist and I wanted to share resources to help those who might be interested in similar topics.
This is a guide to everything that is good for the earth and good for you!

As always, the most sustainable thing you can do is use things you already have, finding a home for things you already have or using them until end of their life.
I'd also like to emphasize the sustainability angle on buying, for items we're bringing into our homes. I've noticed that this takes work and sometimes makes it the 'not-so-convenient' option. 

### Things to note:

 1. FInd local options - stores within your neighborhood. If that is not an option, online works, too.
 2. I don't recommend Amazon unless you have limited options for where you live. Try to club and buy multiple items at once if you do so.
 3. I don't endorse or make a profit from sharing any of these links - just sharing the knowledge
 4. Credit to lots of different resources across the internet
 5. This is a work-in-progress
